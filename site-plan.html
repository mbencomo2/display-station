      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Retro video games are one of my favorite pastimes, especially Sony's PlayStation (TM) 2. With one of the largest libraries of classic video games, 
          it is great fun revisiting classic titles. However, it shouldn't take earning a degree on analogue TV signals or spending an arm or leg on a 
          fancy up-scaling device.  My aim is to help anyone who has wanted to enjoy their classic games with the hardware they already own, while 
          also learning what options are available to restore or enhance the experience.  To that end, my website would offer a simple to understand 
          layout with pages describing ways to connect to your TV and simple modifications so easy your grandma could do it. I already help many friends and 
          people on internet forums. Now is my chance to make a bigger impact on the community.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience are retro gamers and people who are interested in playing Playstation 1 and 2 consoles. The same principles
          apply to retro consoles as a whole, so most 5th generation console owners and older can also benefit from this site as well.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This page will include a short introduction to the website, what it contains and how to navigate. A brief start to the 
        connection tutorial is also available to get visitors started right off the bat.

      <h3>Connect a TV</h3>
      <p>
        1.	What connections does my tv support?<br>
          a.	With so many connection options available, users need to determine what options they have.<br>
        2.	What connections does my console support?<br>
          a.	Older consoles had their own proprietary cables, so users need to ensure they have the proper cabling to connect to their tv.

      <h3>Picture Quality Questions</h3>
      <p>
        3.	What kinds of connections are better? <br>
          a.	Due to the analogue nature of retro video game consoles, there is a lot of math and science involved with the way these 
          connections perform. DisplayStation will provide easy to understand explanations of the pros and cons of different video connections 
          without overwhelming visitors with information. <br>
        4.	My TV doesn’t display right/lags? <br>
          a.	A common issue with older games is they were designed with the low lag and display quirks of old CRT TV’s. This causes new TV’s 
          to either display these games incorrectly or add so much display lag that games do not feel right or become more difficult. 
          In order to address this, DisplayStation will cover common pitfalls and solutions to ensure users can have the best experience possible. <br>
        5.	What enhancements can I use to increase the resolution? <br>
         a.	If users are willing to spend money on it, there are special devices available to upscale and de-interlace old game console 
         video output for new high-resolution TV’s. DisplayStation will list available devices, their costs, where they can be purchased, 
         and what features they include.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Since the plan is to make this website relatively simple to use, I have kept the layout simple. Here you can see the nav 
        bar on the side so the naviagtion is available whenever the user desires. The footer is kept at the bottom, while the header is 
        just the logo that floats in the top right corner. This page will be an introduction, explaining the purpose of the website and 
        helping users get started. For Mobile Users, the layout will shift to a more standard mobile layout with a top and bottom header/footer.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Main_Wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Connect to a TV</h3>
      <p>         
        The layout will be mostly the same, except this time there will be extra panels on the side that will provide important 
        information the user needs to pay attention to. Since the content of the page will be contained within the grid, it should
        be relatively easy to float and position these. The direction of flow will be easy to manage since it is a tutorial, so the 
        user should just continue scrolling down to continue.
      </p>

      <h3>Picture Quality Questions</h3>
      <p>         
        As this page is more of a Question and Answer style, I will put all the questions at the top with links to further down the page. To 
        facilitate easier usage, I will be adding a "Back to Top" panel that will take users back to the top of the page if they want to jump 
        to a new question.
