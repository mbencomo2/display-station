                Understanding what video types your TV supports.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before digital video, there were several video standards that all 
                had their own quirks and features. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>RF/Coaxial - Poor Quality</li>
                <li>Composite - Standard Quality</li>
                <li>S-Video - Better Quality</li>
                <li>Component - Best Quality</li>
                <li>RGB Scart - Best Quality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your console is a Wii/XBOX 360/PS2 or older, you will have these cables instead of HDMI or DisplayPort.</p>
            <img src="images/cables.jpg" alt="Cables" style="width: 100%;">
            <p>
                Now, not all cables produce the same picture quality. There is a lot of math and science behind it, but all you need to know is that <b>composite 
                video</b> (the single yellow cable with red/white audio) is the cheapest and produces a really blurry picture. It is the common denominator that 
                almost all video devices used, since it is comparable to a standard tv signal. Your tv will have a yellow plug labeled "Composite" with a red 
                and a white plug nearby for audio.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have a cable that came with your console. There may be a chance you have a <b>component cable</b> (red/green/blue cables with red/white audio) 
                available. Those will produce a much clearer picture becuase there are 3 times as much bandwidth for the signal. The only problem is not all TVs 
                (especially old CRTs) have this kind of plug available. Use it when available on both your console and TV, otherwise you might need to stick with composite.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last common plug out there is <b>S-Video</b>. Picture quality wise it sits between composite and component video, while being more common than component. 
                it is a round plug with 5 pins inside that was used by some video players and camcorders. If you have a 3rd party video cable it might have an S-Video 
                cable, and use it if you are able. Modern TVs don't use S-Video at all anymore, so don't expect to be able to connect your console to your flat screen 
                with S-Video unless you are lucky enough to have a TV with S-Video input.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RGB Scart</b> was a standard available in Japan and Europe, but was never used in the US. If you buy a console from one of those regions it might be 
                that you have a scart output, but if your TV is made in the US and was made in the last 20 years than you will definately not have a scart input.

                <h3>TV Inputs</h3>
                <img src="images/tv_inputs.jpg" alt="TV Inputs">
                <p>
                    TVs are made to accept all kinds of inputs unless the are old or cheap. They are generally color coded, so just match the colors and you will be fine. 
                    Y/Pb/Pr is the official name for component cables, with Y being green, Pb being blue, and Pr being red. The TV pictured here has a SCART connector, 
                    featured on the far left.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Connecting the cables is simple, just plug the colored cables into the corresponding holes. Don't forget to change the TV's source to the appropriate input
                or else you won't get a picture even if it is plugged in correctly!  At that point you are ready to start enjoying your older games again. If you are still 
                experiencing issues with lag or want a better picture than composite has to offer, than check out the <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Page</a>
