                <p>
                    <b>A:</b> Most TVs will apply some image processing to make TV and movies look "better". Typically they sharpen the image by adding extra 
                    color around edges and other techniques so when you are sitting far away the differences in color are more distinct. The problem 
                    with retro games is they are typically low resolution and designed for a blurry CRT, so the extra processing just messing things 
                    up even more. <br><br>Try digging through your TV's settings and disable sharpening and other post-processing. It might make a 
                    big difference.

                    <b>A:</b> Understand that not all video connections output the same quality. From the figure above you can get a feel for some ot the 
                    differences in picture quality. Most games will not suffer too terribly because they were designed to be played on a CRT which inherently 
                    blurs the picture, but a flat panel TV will sometimes misinterpret the colors and brightness leading to a horrible mess. <br><br>
                    The only ways to fix this is to either get a better cable type or purchase a device that can process the image instead of your TV. These 
                    can be both upscalers and de-interlacers that will convert the console's output to digital but they can be very expensive.

                <h3 id="Q3">Q: I have serious input lag!</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>A:</b> Developers of older games wanted to make their games as tough as nails to increase play time, and took advantage of CRT TVs having almost 
                    no image latency to push button timings to the extreme. Modern TVs are designed to try and "improve" the picture quality, but at the cost 
                    of added lag between frames. This means you are playing with a delay of up to 6 frames that can ruin the experience playing older games. <br><br>
                    The best thing to do is see if your TV has a "gaming" mode that prioritizes low latency for the best experience playing fighting games, multiplayer 
                    games, or other games that require low input lag.
                </p>

                    Many dedicated fans have created devices that are designed to upscale the image to a higher resolution and also add extra processing like adding 
                    or removing scanlines as well as other fancy features. These are devices that sit between the console and the TV, and range in size, features, 
                    and price <br><br>
                    Check out hazard-city's <a href="https://retrogaming.hazard-city.de/">website</a> if you want to learn more about specific devices and what they 
                    can do. My recommendations are the <a href="#">RetroTink 5x</a> , <a href="#">RetroTink 2x</a> , or <a href="#">OSSC</a>.
